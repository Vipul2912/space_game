# Space Game

A simple 2D space shooter game developed using Python and the Pygame library. The game allows players to control a spaceship, navigate through space, and shoot enemies to earn points. It features basic game mechanics like movement, shooting, and collision detection, making it an ideal project for learning game development with Pygame.

## Features

- Control a spaceship and navigate through space.
- Shoot enemies and avoid obstacles.
- Score points by destroying enemies.
- Simple graphics and sound effects for an engaging experience.
- Collision detection for interactions between the spaceship, bullets, and enemies.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** Core programming language used for game logic.
- **Pygame:** Library used for game development, handling graphics, and user input.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Pygame library installed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vipul2912/space_game.git
   cd space_game
   ```

2. **Install Pygame:**

   Install Pygame using pip if it's not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game:**

   Start the game by running the main Python script:

   ```bash
   python space_game.py
   ```

2. **Controls:**

   - Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship up, down, left, and right.
   - Press the spacebar to shoot bullets at incoming enemies.

3. **Objective:**

   - Navigate your spaceship through space and shoot enemies to score points.
   - Avoid collisions with enemies to prevent losing the game.

## Game Mechanics

- **Movement:** Use arrow keys for smooth movement of the spaceship across the screen.
- **Shooting:** Press the spacebar to fire bullets towards enemies.
- **Collision Detection:** The game detects collisions between the spaceship, bullets, and enemies. Destroying enemies with bullets scores points.
- **Game Over:** The game ends if the spaceship collides with an enemy.

## Code Structure

The game is organized into the following key components:

- **Initialization:** Setting up the game window, loading assets (images, sounds), and initializing variables.
- **Game Loop:** The main loop that handles game logic, including event handling, updating positions, checking collisions, and rendering graphics.
- **Event Handling:** Capturing user input for spaceship movement and shooting.
- **Collision Detection:** Checking for interactions between the spaceship, bullets, and enemies.

## Assets

The game uses simple graphics and sound effects to create an engaging experience. You can customize the game by adding your own images and sounds in the assets directory.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding more enemy types and behaviors.
- Implementing power-ups and special abilities for the spaceship.
- Introducing levels with increasing difficulty.
- Enhancing graphics and animations.
